Steps for Execution of Code:

1) Store all module ie. S.py(server code), O.py(operations code), C.py(clients code) in a single folder.
2) Create a new folder named 'Root' in the folder where the three codes exists, Open Root folder and create new folder named 'Admin' and now open the Admin folder and again create a text doctument named 'Register'.
3) Now copy the path of the total folder from step 2, and update the path of the program wherever the data path is present in S.py(server code) and O.py(operations code).
4) Run server code via python s.py then client via. python c.py
5) Now client code gets intiated and we can see two options that is Login and Register. Now we need to select the option either login or register.
6) If the client is new he/she needed to register first,He/she needed to create username and password. If the user is already existed one he can directly login.
7) After loggin to the server with the username and password, We have five operations those are:
            1.Create folder
            2.Writefile
            3.Readfile
            4.List directories
            5.Change Foldername
            0.Logout
8)Now we can access the operations by typing the option we want. If we select the option 0 you will be logged out.
9)If one user using the server, no other user with the same username and password cannot loggin and acess denied prompt can be seen if this occured.

***Note***: In the execution of code if there is any trouble or any error occured we can terminate code by pressing ctrl and C. By pressing ctrl and C the code gets terminated, We need to termintae code in both the prompt windows i.e server prompt and client prompt.
            We can again initilize the codes using the above mentioned steps.
